## Introduction

gem5 is a simulation software used by computer architects both in academia and the industry. Being a simulator, it also provides certain Resources relevant to computer architecture, like Kernels, Bootloaders, Benchmarks, and Disk Images to its users. Currently, the Resources are stored in a Google Cloud Bucket. The only way a user of gem5 can access information regarding which Resources exist is by going through the resources.json file available [here](https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5-resources/+/refs/heads/stable/resources.json) manually, which can be cumbersome. Our main goal is to make *finding Resources easier for gem5 users and integrating it with other components of the gem5 ecosystem*. Part of this goal involves categorizing the available Resources and making these Categories and Groups filtrable, and creating compatibility links between existent Resources. It also involves linking a Resource with example code from the gem5 source code, and also linking it with README files present in the gem5_resources repository. Another aspect of this project is to use a server to track analytics of various Resources.

But, on top of that, to make the user experience better, additional goals include adding a beginners’ section for first-time users of gem5 and adding more information within the frontend rendering and the backend data of a particular Resource page. This information is meant to help users and includes input size, expected output, logging for particular benchmarks within the suite that do not work, dependencies, version compatibilities (with different versions of gem5), download sizes, direct download links for the Resource, and if the Resource is tested or not.

To make the administration of Resources better, additional goals involve integrating MongoDB into the current Python wrapper that downloads Resources.

## Requirements

**User Stories #1: Documentation for a Resource**

Problem: Dr. Finn is a seasoned gem5 researcher who knows the exact ID of the resource he wants to download, down to the architecture, category, and whether he requires SimPoints or not. But, he forgot how to use a resource in gem5.

Solution: All he needs is, therefore, a search bar, where he can enter the ID of the required resource and see the instructions on how to use it in gem5.

**User Stories #2: Advanced Exact Search**

Problem: Dr. Bose is a researcher who requires a particular version of a resource for a particular architecture for a particular release of gem5.

Solution: Therefore, he needs an advanced feature search where they can filter all the resources by their versions, and architectures, and check out instructions for a particular version of gem5.

**User Stories #3: Browsing a Category**

Problem: Professor Lev Bronstein has a simulation setup for RISC-V. He has everything ready now he is trying to look for different Kernels supported by his architecture.

Solution: He can select the category Kernels and filter by RISC-V to check what’s available (under “Advanced Search”).

**User Stories #4: Link to Resource Dependencies**

Problem: Dr. Allison is working on code written by a researcher who no longer works with them. The researcher used some workloads but they don’t know what it does and what it depends upon.

Solution: They know the exact ID for the workload. They need to search the ID for the resources and click on the resources it depends upon.

**User Stories #5: Partial Search**

Problem: Dr. Caroline Bracey is trying to find the Linux kernel (v4.19.83) for x86 systems but they don’t know the exact ID for it. Now she wants to find the ID for it so that they can use it for their x86 simulation.

Solution: Here, she can use the advanced search, select the category as Kernel, Filter by x86 architecture, Filter from “Date Oldest to Newest”, and search for Linux v4.19.83.

OR

Search for Linux v4.19.83, if not satisfied with the results, use the advanced search and choose the category as Kernel, apply the x86 filter, and sort by “Date Oldest to Newest”.

**User Stories #6: Compatibility and Versioning**

Problem: Dr. Kevin Patel recently updated to the new Gem5 version and now are trying to run a simulation that uses the riscv-bootloader-vmlinux-5.10. However, they’re running into compatibility issues since the bootloader was designed for an older version.

Solution: The user now searches for id and views all of the versions for the bootloader and if there is a version that the newest version of gem5 supports. Something similar to [https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_splash/versions](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_splash/versions)

**User Stories #7: Examples of How to Use**

Problem: Neha Kakkar is a researcher who wants to run NAS Parallel Benchmark for a particular system to gem5 but does not know how to use that resource for a particular mode of gem5 (SE or FS).

Solution: Therefore, they need particular instructions for using that resource in SE mode and in FS mode on viewing more information about the resource.

**User Stories #8: Filtering based on SimPoints/checkpoints**

Problem: Professor Jennifer Drakos wants to speed up her simulation time. She would need to pick the exact same resource, down to the gem5 version, resource version, architecture, etc. but just a version with SimPoints or CheckPoints.

Solution: Therefore, she needs a checkbox that can toggle between showing all resources or just resources that support SimPoints or CheckPoints.

**User Stories #9: Seeing Information about a Resource**

Problem: Dr. Harshil is trying to run a simulation for a benchmark suite under RISC-V but gem5 is throwing errors when he loads the benchmark into his code.

Solution: Having documentation with a Resource that lists expected output, input files for the resource, logging for particular benchmarks within the suite that do not work, dependencies and version compatibilities can help the user debug the problem within the resource easier.

**User Stories #10: Existence of filtering by “Groups”**

Problem: Dr. Bao wants to find assembly tests for RISC-V but filtering by “Test” gives a huge number of binaries, and the ID of the resource does not contain “asmtest”, so searching via the search bar does not give an accurate result either.

Solution: Having a group that lists all the Linux kernels, hello tests, print-this binaries and assembly tests can help a user find all versions for all members of these respective groups so that searches that cannot be indexed can still be found.

**User Stories #11: Link to Beginners’ Tutorial**

Problem: Walter Goodman is a beginner to gem5. He does not know what resources are or how to use them in gem5.

Solution: A link to the most commonly used or the most beginner-friendly resources on the homepage would help him get started with using resources in gem5.

**User Stories #12: Change in Documentation**

Problem: Dr. Christina realizes that there is an error with the documentation provided along with a Resource on the website and knows how to fix that error.

Solution: Having a button on the documentation to automatically submit a PR would allow a user to fix it.

**User Stories #13: Filter by Tested**

Problem: Professor Zhuangzi wants to only use resources that have been officially tested by the gem5 community.

Solution: Implementing a verified badge for the resources that have been tested, and implementing a “filter by” option that can display those resources solves this problem.

**User Stories #14: Filter by Tested**

Problem: Dr. Bobby Bruce is the admin of gem5 and he wants to add a new Resource and fix an existing one.

Solution: Specialized CLI tool for Dr. Bruce just for maintaining and adding new Resources.

**User Stories #15: Direct Download with Viewing its Size**

Problem: Dr. Miyamoto wants to directly download an Image file from gem5 resources.

Solution: Having a Download button in the documentation of a resource that leads a user to the page where they can directly download the resource solves this problem. We can also populate the size for the resource while uploading it.

**User Stories #16: Switching of Database**
    
Problem: Dr. Bobby Bruce is the admin of gem5 and wants to maintain the gem5 Vision API and the Resources website even if MongoDB updates its implementation anytime in the future, which might require reworking the API itself.

Solution: Having two versions of the API (one for the JSON and one for MongoDB) and a flag that chooses which API to invoke can help Dr. Bruce maintain the website easier. We can easily switch over to the JSON version while we rework the implementation.
    
**User Stories #17: Documentation for gem5 Vision**
    
Problem: Aditya Kode is an open source contributor of gem5, and wants to contribute to gem5 Vision, but does not understand how its current implementation works.

Solution: Having documentation that explains the API and its functions would help Aditya understand how the codebase works.
    
**User Stories #18: Contributing to gem5**
    
Problem: The Spidermen are a team working on some components for gem5, but cannot push their code onto gem5’s Gerrit Code Review due to stylistic errors.

Solution: Following the gem5 code conventions, as detailed in [https://www.gem5.org/contributing](https://www.gem5.org/contributing), would help make contributing to gem5 a lot easier.

**User Stories #19: Sorting**

Problem: Peter Parker is trying to find a particular resource but doesn’t know its exact name for it. He tries searching but his query gives him over 100 results. He tries to use the filters but he doesn’t know the category or the architecture.

Solution: Peter sorts the results by relevance and after looking through the first 5-6 results and finds the one he is looking for.

## Cost Analysis

**Option 1:  No server + ReactJs + JSON**

Advantages:

- Easy to transition from the current implementation
- Cheapest

Disadvantages:

- Harder to maintain once the number of resources increases
- Inefficient searches, will not be able to support search query expressions
- Difficult to scale up
- Difficult to implement time-efficient sorting and filtering since we’ll need to fetch the entire JSON for any operation

Cost: Hosting on GitHub Pages can give $0/month. Therefore, for our use case, the total cost will be ****************$0/month****************.

**Option 2:  No server + ReactJs + MongoDB**

Advantages:

- Can support search query expressions like:
  - “exact phrase”
  - category:Kernels
  - dependency:resource:”XYZ”: direct dependency
  - dependency*:resource:”XYZ”: indirect dependency

Disadvantages:

- Less secure since everything is happening client's side
- Not possible to scale up
- No flexibility, since once we decide on a methodology to fetch data, it is set in stone (No API calls)
- Search query expressions are supported, but having different API endpoints makes it easier to debug and serve data in different formats if required (link and JSON)

Cost: MongoDB is free up to 5GB storage of text data. For 1TB of storage, the price is $0.10 per million reads. Hosting on GitHub Pages can give $0/month. Therefore, for our use case, the total cost will be ****************$0/month****************.

**Option 3:  Cheap Server (Hosting: Heroku/Render.com)+ ReactJs + MongoDB**

Also used by similar projects like:

- Flutter pub.dev: [https://pub.dev](https://pub.dev/)
- Python pip: [https://pypi.org](https://pypi.org/), Explanation: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager))

Advantages:

It provides the following advantages on top of those provided by Option 2:

- Can reuse code for both website and python wrapper
- Can easily modify API endpoints later if needed
- Makes it easier to debug and serve data in different formats if required
- If we want to extend to user-uploaded resources, a server is necessary for authentication
- Greatly increases the security: Most of the processing is server side and thus not much is visible to the end user
- Can easily scale this to AWS EC2+ELB later

Disadvantages:

- Might involve a bit of work to horizontally scale
- Cannot expand to multiple regions

Cost: [Render.com](http://Render.com) is free. Heroku is $5 and limited to 1000 dyno-hours (hours of API used) a month. Unlimited at a basic tier is $7 dollars an hour. Therefore, for our use case, the total cost will be ****************$0-7/month****************.

**Option 4:  AWS EC2 + Load Balancer (AWS Elastic Beanstalk) + ReactJs + DynamoDB (AWS-supported database)/MongoDB**

Advantages:

It provides the following advantages on top of those provided by Options 2 and 3:

- Can horizontally scale this infinitely
- Can expand to other regions too

Disadvantages:

- Expensive
- The learning curve to understand how it works

Cost: [https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/) - t4g.nano or t4g.micro. The price is $0.0042 an hour and $0.0084 an hour. Multiplying that by 24 hours for 31 days gives us an upper limit of $3.13/month to $6.25/month. Amazon LightSail is free for a year and then costs $3.50 a month. Therefore, for our use case, the total cost will be **$3.13-6.25/month**.
